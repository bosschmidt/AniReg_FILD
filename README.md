The 'Anisotropic_Regularization_for_Inversion_of_Fast-Ion_Loss_Detector_Measurements_Examples.ipynb' Jupyter Notebook contains examples for reconstructing results from the paper 'Anisotropic Regularization for Inversion of Fast-Ion Loss Detector Measurements' submitted to Nuclear Fusion.
Running the Jupyter Notebook requires a Core Imaging Library (CIL) kernel; see https://ccpi.ac.uk/cil/. CIL version 23.1.0 was used for all computations in the manuscript.
